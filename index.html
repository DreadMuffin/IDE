I placed the javascript image before the title, because I could easily
place it entirely in the head then. Alternatively I would have had to make
a javascript function and call it in the body. Javascript reads from top
to bottom and you cannot append to an object which does not exists.

<h2>Question 6</h2>

<ul style="list-style-type:disc">
  <li>
    <a
    href="http://www.babynamewizard.com/voyager#prefix=&sw=both&exact=false">
      baby names</a> is one of my all time favourite visualizations. The idea is
    very simple, but the way it instantly shifts to match your entered letters
    is very satisfying. Hovering the mouse over the graph shows data dependent
   both on the name you are hovering over and the year on the x-axis. Clicking
    on a name takes you to all names starting with those letters and as a bonus
    feature you are forwarded to the name's etymology if you click it again. 
    It is hard to find negatives about this, but the first look at it, is not
    particularly good. You are greeted with a mess of colors, a text entry box,
    radio buttons and a strange color guide. The graph is however pretty clear
    once you have made your first interactions with it.
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="http://www.syria-visualized.com/">
      Syria refuges</a> is a visualization of violence is spreading in Syria. I
    will only talk about the topmost visualization. It
    does a great job conveying not only how much, but what kind of violence is
    happening. It shows it day by day and it is mortifying to behold. You can
    filter it to only show violence by certain groups or of certain kinds. It is
    very effective at showing just how quickly the crisis escalated (the data
    stopped in January 2015). If I were to nitpick it, I dislike that when you
    hover your mouse over a country it gives the impression of being clickable,
    but only shows the name. This would be alright, if it kept being highlighted
    while I had my mouse over a dot on the map. However it disappears and I
    cannot click the dot, nor see the name of the country. The color choices
    were made for effect, but the gray on gray with dramatic red does make the
    thing blur a bit.

<h2>Question 7</h2>
<h3>Lasse Madsen</h3>
<ul>
  <li>I would like to visualize some video game data, maybe try to show Warcraft
  3 replays. I know they have a format where you can read every action taken in
  the game. I could just use random replays.</li>
  <li>It would show what happened in a game. You could highlight particular
  events and perhaps find the "interesting" parts.</li>
  <li>While Warcraft 3 is, if not dead, dying I think a lot of people would at
  the very least find it cool.</li>
