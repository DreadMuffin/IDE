<h1>Assignment 2</h1>

I started working on this assignment an hour before the deadline. I
don not really have any excuses nor do I wish to make any. I will try to join a
group for the next assignment and get something done. This is for all intents
and purposes a blank hand-in. I would appreciate if this was not shared like the
other assignments, but that is up to you.
